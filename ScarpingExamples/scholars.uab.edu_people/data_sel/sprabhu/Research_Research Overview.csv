,Research Overview
0,"Dr. Prabhu's research focus has been to understand the fundamental mechanisms of pathological remodeling in the failing heart, with a particular focus on inflammatory pathways (tumor necrosis factor, nuclear factor-kappaB) and immune cells (e.g., macrophages, T-cells). He is also interested in the interplay between inflammatory signaling and stem cell-mediated repair of the failing heart. Clinical studies include profiling immune cell networks in human heart failure, and defining the effects of mechanical circulatory support on forward and reverse remodeling."
