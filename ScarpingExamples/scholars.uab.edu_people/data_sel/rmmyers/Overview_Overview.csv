0,"Richard Myers, Ph.D., received his B.S. in biochemistry from the University of Alabama in 1977, his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California at Berkeley and performed post-doctoral work at Harvard University. He began his first faculty position at the University of California at San Francisco in 1986 and moved his laboratory to Stanford University’s Department of Genetics in 1993. At Stanford, he was chair of the Department of Genetics and director of the Stanford Human Genome Center, which contributed more than 10 percent of the data in the public Human Genome Project’s efforts to sequence the human genome. Dr. Myers moved to HudsonAlpha in July 2008. Myers’s research program is focused on human genetics and genomics. Work in his laboratory has led to the identification of genes involved in several inherited diseases, and his genome center contributed more than 10 percent of the data in the public Human Genome Project’s efforts to sequence the human genome. His lab continues to use genomics tools and genetics to understand how genes interacting with the environment contribute to human diseases and other traits. Myers has won several awards, including the Pritzker Award and an honorary doctorate of human letters from the University of Alabama. He is an editor of Genome Research and reviews manuscripts for a variety of other journals."
