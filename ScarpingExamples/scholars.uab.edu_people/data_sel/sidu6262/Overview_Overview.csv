0,"I have worked in the mental healthcare field since 2005.  My experience is as an outpatient therapist, residential program manager, and Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner working with patients across the lifespan.  I have found academia and clinical practice to be very complimentary activities, augmenting the other and resulting in better care and better education."
