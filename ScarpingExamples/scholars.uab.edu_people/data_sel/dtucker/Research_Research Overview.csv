,Research Overview
0,"Dr. Tucker’s research examines genetic influences on disease from a number of perspectives. While her initial work examined mechanisms by which early experience might affect cardiovascular development in an animal model of hypertension, more recently her work has examined how people understand genetically based risk for disease and how information about risk is communication within families. Dr. Tucker’s group was part of UAB’s contribution to the HEIRS study, a large, multicenter study examining the feasibility and desirability of widespread genetic screening for a heritable, frequently undetected disorder called hemachromatosis. This disorder is especially interesting because the deleterious consequences of the genetic defect can be completely prevented by early detection and treatment. The HEIRS study provides an unequalled opportunity to examine the consequences of genetic screening in a multiethnic population. She has been a co-author on two studies examining evidence for discrimination resulting from genetic test results. Dr. Tucker’s current research is in the area of cancer survivorship, end of life issues and palliative care. Cancer survivorship, end of life issues, palliative care"
