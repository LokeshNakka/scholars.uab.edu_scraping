,Research Overview
0,"Small or Large we deliver all! It's all about DELIVERY. Our research is centered on the interface of polymers and therapeutics at the nano-micro or macro-scale to prevent, manage or treat diseases using drugs or drug-like compounds or their combinations. We apply innovative delivery strategies to existing small or large molecules improving the risk vs benefit ratio; realize new indications or apply the innovative delivery technologies early on in the drug discovery program to minimize the attrition rates. Ongoing Projects a) Systemic anti-inflammatory therapy to prevent or delay diabetic cataracts and treat post-surgical inflammation (NEI-NIH) b) Oral delivery of insulin using ligand-directed nanoparticles that do not compete with physiological ligands (NIDDK-NIH) c) Engineering the next generation nanoparticle cyclosporine A therapy in lupus (NIAID-NIH) d) Urolithin A nanoparticle therapy for acute kidney injury (NIDDK-NIH)"
